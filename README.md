# MachineLearning Projects

### Abstract 
These are machinelearning projects which contains three parts.     
The first project is building a Logistic Regression model without sklearn and use titanic dataset and mnist dataset to train and test model.   

[Lets go to project1](https://github.com/edwinobstre/MachineLearning/Project1)

The second project is a nlp that learning the comment data from imdb, amazon and yelp to predict the label of new comment in testset.

The third project is a recommendation system. Here using the surprise package and movie-len 100k dataset to fulfill a movie recommendation system.
